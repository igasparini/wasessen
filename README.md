To implement the frontend of the "wasessen" application using Sveltekit, we will need several files. The main files will be:

- package.json: This file will contain the project metadata and dependencies.
- svelte.config.js: This file will contain the configuration for the Sveltekit application.
- src/routes/index.svelte: This file will contain the code for the homepage.
- src/routes/recipe.svelte: This file will contain the code for the recipe recommendation form and the recipe display page.
- src/lib/ApiService.js: This file will contain the code for interacting with the backend API.

Let's start with the package.json file:
