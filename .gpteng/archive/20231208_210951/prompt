App: backend framework: FastAPI. Frontend framework: Sveltekit.

Project: Develop a mobile-optimized web application named "wasessen" ("what to eat?") to provide users with recipe ideas based on their preferences.

Primary Goal: The app should offer personalized recipe recommendations based on user-specified criteria like cooking time, calories, and optional keywords.

Data Management:

Utilize the structured data files in the "recipes" folder:
dishes.csv: Contains dishes with ID, slug, and other information.
ingredient_and_instructions.json: Holds ingredients and instructions keyed by dish slug.
tags.csv: Associates tags with dishes.

Key Features and Flow:

Homepage Design:
Feature the 'wasessen' logo (file: logo.png).
Include two buttons: "Recipe now!" and "Weekly menu" (non-functional for now).
Recipe Recommendation Feature:
The "Recipe now!" button leads to a form for specifying cooking time, calories, and optional keywords.
A submission button to process the request.
Recipe Display Page:
Display a recipe matching the user's criteria, sourced from the provided files.
Implement efficient file reading and searching logic for quick recipe retrieval.
UI/UX Design:
